## Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming in C/C++

This repository is created to share the materials I, personally, have developed to teach the Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming in C++ course in Fall 2021 at the [Department of Computer Sciecne](https://www.tntech.edu/engineering/programs/csc/index.php), [Tennessee Tech University](https://www.tntech.edu/). The content of the course is as follows:
- [Intro to C++](./1_intro_to_c++)
- [Variables and Assignments](./2_variables_and_assignments)
- [Branches and Flow Control](./3_branches_and_flow_control)
- [Loops](./4_loops)
- [Functions and Pointers](./5_functions_and_pointers)
- [Arrays and Pointers](./6_arrays_and_pointers)
- [Strings and Pointers](./7_strings_and_pointers)
- [Vectors](./8_vectors)
- [File I/O](./9_file_io)
- [Structures](./10_structures)

Each chapter contains the slide deck used to teach the class, a set of coding examples to better understand the topics, and a list of helpful resources.
