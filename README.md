## Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming in C/C++

This repository is created to share the materials I, personally, have developed to teach the Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming in C++ course in Fall 2021 at the [Department of Computer Sciecne](https://www.tntech.edu/engineering/programs/csc/index.php), [Tennessee Tech University](https://www.tntech.edu/). The contents of the course are as follows:
- Intro to C++
- Variables and Assignments
- Branches and Flow Control
- Loops
- Functions and Pointers
- Arrays and Pointers
- Strings and Pointers
- Vectors
- File I/O
- Structures

Each chapter contains the slide deck used to teach the class and a set of coding examples to better understand the topics.
